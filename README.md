# Bytelang
Bytelang is a programming language for the Java platform. It could be also called *"Assembler for Java"* since it has been designed for low-level description of `*`.class files.

## What is it for?
There're few groups of people who might find Bytelang useful:
  * JVM developers
  * Decompilers developers
  * Class-file manipulation tool or libraries developers
  * Hobby programmers (for Java4k contest etc)

## How do I use it?
Download an executable JAR file and move it to some handy location (e.g. /usr/bin/). After having that done, nothing is simpler than compiling your first code. Example:

`$ bytelang HelloWorld.jsm HelloWorld.class`

## Examples
You may look in [example applications](https://github.com/tzima/Bytelang/tree/master/BytelangExamples). If you know Java bytecode and structure of Class file, you'll probably understand what's going on.

## Where do I find a handbook?
Unfortunately, there isn't one in the moment. Until official documentation is done, you may study examples and JVM specification

## Warning
This is *not* an ordinary conventional programming language. It's terribly difficult to actually create a large application in that. You won't have idea what you're doing without having expert-level knowledges of Java platform [study material](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/). Don't waste your time unless you are sure that this language & compiler is exactly what you need or want.
